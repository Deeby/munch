Munch
======

With two modes (FS and SF), this tool performs a sequence of fuzzing and concolic execution on C programs (compiled into LLVM bitcode). The goal is to increase function coverage and, hopefully, finding more (buffer-overflow) vulnerabilities than symbolic execution or fuzzing. 

[__AFL__](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) is used for (blackbox) fuzzing. Ideally, this stage should cover most of the easy-to-reach functions in the programs. 

[__KLEE22__](https://github.com/tum-i22/klee22/tree/sonar) is used for concolic execution. It is a custom fork of KLEE with a specialized implementation of targeted path search, called *sonar* search. Ideally, this stage should cover the (hard-to-reach) functions that were not discovered with fuzzing in the first step. 

## Prerequisites
Munch requires the following softwares:
- [Macke](https://github.com/tum-i22/macke)
- [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) 
- KLEE22: This should be installed after Macke's installation
- [afl-cov](https://github.com/mrash/afl-cov)

## Usage

### FS mode
1) Before running FS mode, you should prepare the following files and objects:
- Two different executables, which are generated by compiling the tested program using AFL and KLEE without any optimizations.
- The `afl-cov` results (`afl_output`) from SF mode.
- Configuration file (JSON) 
```
{
    "AFL_OBJECT": "",       # The executable generated by compiling with AFL
    "LLVM_OBJECT": "",      # The bc file generated by compiling with KLEE
    "WHICH_KLEE": "",       # The executable of KLEE
    "AFL_FOLDER_NAME": "",  # The folder name of afl-cov
    "SEARCH_NAME": "",      # The search method to run KLEE
    "TARGET_INFO": "",      # Argument key to the search
    "SYM_STDIN": "",        # Additional arguments (value: stdin) in KLEE
    "SYM_ARGS": "",         # Additional arguments (key) in KLEE
    "SYM_FILES": "",        # Additional arguments (value: file) in KLEE
    "FUNC_TIME": ""         # The value for max-time in KLEE
}
```
2) Basic `--help` output is below:
```
usage: python fs.py [-h] -c CONFIG

Munch FS mode

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        Path to the configuration file
```
