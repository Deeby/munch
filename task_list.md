# My Tasks

Task list (19.01.2017)

- [x] make a script to check the crashes folder after fuzzing the obfuscated progs and check how many of them find the "You win"
- [x] Targeted Search: Check inside tofuzz/virt/ folder and check if it finds multiple paths inside RandomFunc
	- Set target "RandomFunc"
	- Run KLEE with targeted search for 15 mins
	- Check how many paths inside RandomFunc are covered by KLEE 

Task list (21.12.2016)

- [x] create a script to automatically add the patch for editing main to read input from stdin (to work with afl)
- [ ] run the script to the obfuscated programs from Sebastian and check if it works
- [ ] push the changes for targeted search to my forked repo

Task list (15.12.2016)

- [x] Apply our targeted search implementation on RandomFunc generated by tigress
- [x] Check with klee_assert if the targeted function is covered
- [x] Check also if the specific line with the password is covered from afl-fuzz

Task list (12.12.2016)

- [x] Fixed targeted search in Search.cpp so it checks also for the targeted function in order to switch searching strategy

Task list (01.12.2016)

- [x] Check the fork() function of KLEE and make sure that our implementation for targeted search works

Task list (24.11.2016)

- [x] Check that our implementation for targeted-search works well
- [x] write a script for the whole process 
	- get all functions of a program in topological order
	- get a list for functions not covered by afl and keep the list topologically ordered
	- after each run of KLEE remove also the functions that were covered by the current run
	- probably will need to add a timeout in case of big programs where not all functions can be covered
	 
Task list (17.11.2016)

- In `ExecutionState.h` add a boolean flag: *targetFunc*

- In `ExecutionState.cpp`:

	- In the constructor -> initialize it to false
	- In the Copy Constructor -> assign the previous value : state.flag
	- In merge() -> handle the flag accordingly
	- In branch() -> handle the flag accordingly
	- In pushFrame() -> check: if functionName == myTarget then set the boolean flag to true

- Check how to use the command line values in LLVM in multiple files : save the value from the cl in a global variable

- Run KLEE with option to disable inlining
	
	```
	 $ klee --disable-inlining -search=ld2t -targeted-function=<func_name> <filename.bc> 
	``` 

Task list (11.11.2016)

- Modify the searching strategy in MACKE in order to continue the searching after it reached the `target`.
	- Probably the whole implementation of Ld2t should change to distinguish the nodes of the call graph into 3 categories:
		- nodes that will never reach the target 
		- nodes that can reach the target (including the target itself)
		- nodes that were reached after reaching the target 	 	

Task list (04.11.2016)

- [x] Install MACKE and KLEE with *targeted search*
- [x] Use MACKE to get the list of functions of a program (A)
- [x] Compile twice with afl-clang
	- to .bc file
	- to binary
- [x] Use afl-fuzz on the binary, run afl-cov and get func_coverage (B) 
- [x] and then run with KLEE the .bc file with targeted search with functions C=(A-B)
- [x] make a script to automate the whole process

Task list (27.10.2016)

- [x] Use *afl-clang* to compile Regexp.c (KLEE-examples) and 
	- generate Regexp.bc file and run it with KLEE
	- generate the instrumented binary and fuzz it with AFL
	- the '-O3' option from the params of the compiler should be removed from the **afl-gcc.c** file in order to work properly
	- Compilation command invoking afl-clang is now: 

	 ```
	 $ clang -emit-llvm -c <program_name>.c \
	  	  -B path/to/as -no-integrated-as -g -funroll-loops -D__AFL_COMPILER=1
	 ```
	 or compile with AFL\_DONT\_OPTIMIZE=1
	 
	 - cannot make it run using **afl-clang-fast** - I get this error after running with KLEE:
	 	
	 	```
	 	KLEE: WARNING: undefined reference to variable: \__afl\_area\_ptr
		KLEE: WARNING: undefined reference to variable: \__afl\_prev\_loc
		KLEE: ERROR: unable to load symbol(__afl_area_ptr) while initializing globals.
		```		 	
	 
- [x] Run afl-cov on the results and create a script to find the functions that were covered
	 
Task list (20.10.2016)

- [x] Try with AFL Thomas programs:
	- less-481
	- diff-3.4
	- tar-1.29	
	- grep-2.25
	- bison-3.0.4	

Task list (13.10.2016)

- [x] Try all KLEE found errors - can they be found by AFL?
- [x] Try all the bugs with KLEE again (coreutils-6.10) - same time as the paper*2

Task list (06.10.2016)

- [x] Search for papers that have already covered things around the area we are working on
- [x] Check the KLEE paper to see which coreutils crash (and which lines are covered) and test with afl to see if we can get the same results (~24h fuzzing)

Task list (29.09.2016)

- [x] Use ASAN with afl and read the output
	- add to PATH llvm-symbolizer and then run the output with: 	 ASAN_OPTIONS=symbolize=1 ./a.out
- [x] read the tests in crashes folder and try to find their contents
- [x] MACKE example doesn't run properly with afl
- [x] make scripts to produce code coverage results from afl-fuzz test cases

Task list (08.09.2016)

- [x] Repeat previous week's tasks
- [x] Check also the simple example that crashes from MACKE
- [x] Look on Google Scholar for any papers that compare symbolic execution and AFL

Task list (30.08.2016)

- [x] Get the coverage from coreutils fuzzed with AFL
	- check for the crashes + hangs:
		- afl-cov checks only the queue folder
	- compute also the percentage of coverage:
		-  gcc -fpreprocessed -dD -E -P SRC_FILE--> removes new lines and comments
	
- [x] Run the Regexp.c program from KLEE and fuzz it with AFL
	- Check if it finds crashes like KLEE
	
Task list (25.08.2016)

- [x] Run script again for all coreutils apart from the problematic ones

Things to discuss after holidays (19.08.2016):

1. List all coreutils that are not fuzzed (approx. 20)
2. List all crashes and hangs 
	- Classify w.o.t coreultils
	- Get test input
3. Get full coverage information
4. Run AFL for remaining coreutils
5. Run on obfuscated programs
